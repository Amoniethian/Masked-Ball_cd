                <p>Played Lobkowicz last night. Candlelight, thirty people, the Imperial. Closed with <em>The Forgotten Waltz</em>.</p>
                <p class="cn">昨晚在洛布科维茨演奏。烛光，三十个人，帝王琴。用《被遗忘的华尔兹》收尾。</p>
                <p>A man in the front row cried. He said the piece reminded him of his wife. He held my hand for a long time and didn't say anything else.</p>
                <p class="cn">前排一位老人哭了。他说这首曲子让他想起了妻子。他握了我的手很久，没有再说别的。</p>

                <p class="cn">音乐就该如此。不是填满房间，而是清空它。</p>

                <p class="cn">黎明时分开车回去。整座城市只剩雾和石头。</p>
                <p><small>P.S. — Woke at 3am again. New pages on the stand. Don't remember writing them. The melodies are better than anything I write awake. Father says genius works like that — in the dark, without permission. Maybe.</small></p>
                <p class="cn"><small>附言——又在凌晨三点醒了。谱架上多了几页新的。不记得写过。那些旋律比我清醒时写的好得多。父亲说天才就是这样运作的——在黑暗中，不经允许。也许吧。</small></p>

                <p class="cn"><small>我应该坦白。今早在琴凳里发现了最后三页。看起来是我的笔迹。但第三乐章——非凡。远超我清醒时能写出的任何东西。父亲的医生说是入睡前创造力。我不觉得是那样。太好了。好得像是别人通过我写的。</small></p>
